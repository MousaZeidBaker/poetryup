PoetryUp updates dependencies and bumps their version in the `pyproject.toml`
file with respect to their version constraint. The `poetry.lock` file will be
recreated as well. PoetryUp runs
[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) commands, thus it's required
to be installed. The difference between running `poetry update` and `poetryup`,
is that the latter also modifies the `pyproject.toml` file.
